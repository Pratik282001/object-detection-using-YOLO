# Object Detection Using YOLO

Yolo is a Deep Learning algorithm which is used to perform object detection in images or real time videos. 

In this project I created a package using which you can easily add object detection functionalities in any of your application.

As YOLO is very Dense Neural Network, it need lot of computing power to execute. Therefor I will suggest to use GPU while running these programs.

**Prerequisit for this project** - 
  * **coco.names** - This file contains the label names. I included this file in the repository.
  * **yolo3.weights** - This file contains the weights that will be required to generate a neural network model. You can download it from https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/
  * **yolo3.cfg** - This file contains the architecture of the neural network.
  * **Input Shape** - There are different input shape of images for different type of architecture of Yolo model. You have to check that what is the input shape for your yolo model.
